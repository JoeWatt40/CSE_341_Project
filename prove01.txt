After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
   https://github.com/JoeWatt40/CSE_341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
   Users are entered and showing in the console with localhost:3000
   In localhost:3000/users each user entered shows up in an order list

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
   It seems like everything is working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
   The "coolest" thing that I learned in this assignment is how to connect the files
   and make the files go from one IF statement to an other and perform what you 
   wanted it to.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
   The biggest thing I needed help on(that I got from the TA) was the startup in the package.json
   file. It wasn't clear to me exactly what instruction #3 ment. The TA also gave me the idea on how
   to get the data from the form array into an array I could use in /users.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
   I think #5 describes my assignment.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
   I believe my assignment meets number 5 because it uses all three routes asked and
   displays the users in a list.
